# FizzBuzz World: Embrace the FizzBuzz Challenge in Go!

Welcome to the playground for exploring the classic FizzBuzz problem and its intriguing variations in Go!

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a simple programming challenge that involves printing numbers from 1 to N, but with a twist:
- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
- If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

But here's where it gets exciting: we're not stopping at the classic FizzBuzz. We're diving deep into the world of creative variations!

## Explore the Variations

In this repository, you'll find different implementations of FizzBuzz, each with its own twist. From classic solutions to innovative approaches, we've got it all:

- [Classic](implementations/classic/fizz_buzz.go)
- [Without Conditionals](implementations/no_ifs/fizz_buzz.go)
- [Four For](implementations/four_for/four_for.go)
- [Lucky Number](implementations/lucky_number/fizz_buzz.go)

Your creativity is the limit!

## How to Contribute

We believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development. Whether you're a seasoned Go developer or just getting started, there are plenty of ways to contribute:
- Implement a new variation of FizzBuzz.
- Write tests to make sure the implementations are correct.
- Add a `README.md` file to explain your solution (if needed).
- Create a PR to the repo and share your knowledge with others!
