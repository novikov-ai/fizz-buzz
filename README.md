# Fizz Buzz World: Embrace the FizzBuzz Challenge in Go!

Welcome to the playground for exploring the classic FizzBuzz problem and its intriguing variations in Go!

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a simple programming challenge that involves printing numbers from 1 to N, but with a twist:
- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

But here's where it gets exciting: we're not stopping at the classic FizzBuzz. We're diving deep into the world of variations!

## Explore the Variations

In this repository, you'll find different implementations of FizzBuzz, each with its own twist. From classic solutions to innovative approaches, we've got it all:

- [Classic](implementations/classic/fizz_buzz.go)
- [Without Using Conditionals](implementations/no_ifs/fizz_buzz.go)
- [Four For](implementations/four_for/four_for.go)
- [Lucky Number](implementations/lucky_number/fizz_buzz.go)

Your creativity is the limit!

## How to Contribute

We believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development. Whether you're a seasoned Go developer or just getting started, there are plenty of ways to contribute:
- Implement a new variation of FizzBuzz
- Make the tests pass
- Add README.md (if needed to explain your solution)
- Create a PR to the repo and share you knowledge with others!

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how to get started:
1. Clone the repository:

**https**
~~~
git clone https://github.com/novikov-ai/fizz-buzz-world.git
~~~

**ssh**
~~~
git clone git@github.com:novikov-ai/fizz-buzz-world.git
~~~

2. Explore the `implementations` directory for checking whether your idea already exists

3. If you come with a new solution see [PR](https://github.com/novikov-ai/fizz-buzz/pull/3/files) and do the same with your idea (use [boilerplate](boilerplate/README.md))

4. Make sure, that all tests have passed. Just do the command:

~~~
make tests
~~~

5. Submit a pull request and let's collaborate, brainstorm, share knowledge, and build something amazing together!
